- Who created it and when (origin story, key contributors)

### What It Is

[2-3 paragraphs explaining:]
- Clear definition and classification (what category of tool/framework/protocol)
- Core value proposition in one sentence
- How it differs from what came before at a high level
- Target audience and intended use cases

**Sources:** [1], [2], [3]

- Memory, CPU, latency profiles if relevant

### Known Limitations

[2-3 paragraphs covering:]
